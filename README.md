Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) Policy
At Plotalot, we are committed to protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation. We have a zero-tolerance policy toward any behavior or content that exploits, abuses, or endangers children.

What is CSAE?
CSAE refers to child sexual abuse and exploitation, including but not limited to:

Grooming a child for sexual exploitation.
Sextorting a child.
Trafficking a child for sex.
Any content or behavior that sexually exploits or endangers children.
Our Commitment
We take the following steps to prevent and address CSAE:

Content Moderation: All user-generated content is monitored for inappropriate material. Content violating our policy is removed, and offending users are banned.
Reporting Mechanisms: Users can report CSAE content or behavior via our app’s reporting system or by contacting us directly at plotalot.official@gmail.com.
Law Enforcement Cooperation: We work with law enforcement agencies to investigate and address CSAE cases.
